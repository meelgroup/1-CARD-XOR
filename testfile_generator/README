Steps to generate CARD-XOR files

1) The PBLib Fork is located at https://github.com/master-keying/pblib. Compile the source code.
2) Go to the '''pblib''' folder.
    > cp ../build/pblib.a .
4) Copy the '<cardxorconverter.cpp>' file to the '<pblib>' folder.
    > g++ -std=c++11 cardxorconverter.cpp libpb.a  && mkdir testfiles && mv a.out testfiles/
6) Choose the encoding {ADDER, BDD, CARD}. Choose the number of variables you need in the cnf and the number of times
   you want to conduct the experiment.
    > ./a.out ENCODING NUMVAR NUMEXP

This executable generates *n x n* CNF files with *n* variables (projected) going through all the parameters discussed in the paper.
