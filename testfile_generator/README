Steps to generate CARD-XOR files

1) The PBLib Fork is located at <https://github.com/master-keying/pblib>. Compile the source code.
2) Go to the pblib folder.
3) > cp ../build/pblib.a .
4) Copy the cardxorconverter.cpp file to the pblib folder.
5) > g++ -std=c++11 cardxorconverter.cpp libpb.a  && mkdir testfiles && mv a.out testfiles/
6) Choose the encoding {ADDER, BDD, CARD}. Choose the number of variables you need in the cnf and the number of times
   you want to conduct the experiment.
7) > ./a.out ENCODING NUMVAR NUMEXP
