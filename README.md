# 1-CARD-XOR
Scripts and data for *["Phase Transition Behavior of Cardinality and XOR Constraints"](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/0162.pdf)*, IJCAI-19

1) pb-experiments folder has the graphs used in the paper and some more. 

2) testfile_generator folder has the C++ code to generate the CARD-XOR CNFs we use in our experiments.

We ran our experiments with the SAT solver [CryptoMiniSAT5](https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat)
