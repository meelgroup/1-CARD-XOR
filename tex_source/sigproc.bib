abstract="Recent research on Boolean satisfiability (SAT) reveals modern solvers' inability to handle formulae in the abundance of parity (xor) constraints. Although xor-handling in SAT solving has attracted much attention, challenges remain to completely deduce xor-inferred implications and conflicts, to effectively reduce expensive overhead, and to directly generate compact interpolants. This paper integrates SAT solving tightly with Gaussian elimination in the style of Dantzig's simplex method. It yields a powerful tool overcoming these challenges. Experiments show promising performance improvements and efficient derivation of compact interpolants, which are otherwise unobtainable.",

	abstract={Recent universal-hashing based approaches to sampling and counting crucially depend on the runtime performance of \SAT~solvers on formulas expressed as the conjunction of both CNF constraints and variable-width XOR constraintsints (known as CNF-XOR formulas). In this paper, we present the first study of the runtime behavior of \SAT~solvers equipped with XOR-reasoning techniques on random CNF-XOR formulas. We empirically demonstrate that a state-of-the-art \SAT~solver scales exponentially on random CNF-XOR formulas across a wide range of XOR-clause densities, peaking around the empirical phase-transition location. On the theoretical front, we prove that the solution space of a random CNF-XOR formula `shatters' at \emph{all} nonzero XOR-clause densities into well-separated components, similar to the behavior seen in random CNF formulas known to be difficult for many \SAT-solving algorithms.},

	abstract={The runtime performance of modern SAT solvers on random k-CNF formulas is deeply connected with the `phase-transition' phenomenon seen empirically in the satisfiability of random k-CNF formulas. Recent universal hashing-based approaches to sampling and counting crucially depend on the runtime performance of SAT solvers on formulas expressed as the conjunction of both k-CNF and XOR constraints (known as k-CNF-XOR formulas), but the behavior of random k-CNF-XOR formulas is unexplored in prior work. In this paper, we present the first study of the satisfiability of random k-CNF-XOR formulas. We show empirical evidence of a surprising phase-transition that follows a linear trade-off between k-CNF and XOR constraints. Furthermore, we prove that a phase-transition for k-CNF-XOR formulas exists for k = 2 and (when the number of k-CNF constraints is small) for k > 2.},

We combine variable elimination with subsumption and self-subsuming resolution, and show that these techniques not only shrink the formula further than previous preprocessing efforts based on variable elimination, but also decrease runtime of SAT solvers substantially for typical industrial SAT problems. We discuss critical implementation details that make the reduction procedure fast enough to be practical.",

	abstract="The problem of radio frequency assignment is to provide communication channels from limited spectral resources whilst keeping to a minimum the interference suffered by those whishing to communicate in a given radio communication network. This problem is a combinatorial (NP-hard) optimization problem. In 1993, the CELAR (the French ``Centre d'Electronique de l'Armement'') built a suite of simplified versions of Radio Link Frequency Assignment Problems (RLFAP) starting from data on a real network Roisnel93. Initially designed for assessing the performances of several Constraint Logic Programming languages, these benchmarks have been made available to the public in the framework of the European EUCLID project CALMA (Combinatorial Algorithms for Military Applications). These problems should look very attractive to the CSP community: the problem is simple to represent, all constraints are binary and involve finite domain variables. They nevertheless have some of the flavors of real problems (including large size and several optimization criteria). This paper gives essential facts about the CELAR instances and also introduces the GRAPH instances which were generated during the CALMA project.",

abstract ={Determining the satisfiability of randomly generated Boolean expressions with k variables per clause is a popular test for the performance of search algorithms in artificial intelligence and computer science. It is known that for k = 2, formulas are almost always satisfiable when the ratio of clauses to variables is less than 1; for ratios larger than 1, the formulas are almost never satisfiable. Similar sharp threshold behavior is observed for higher values of k. Finite-size scaling, a method from statistical physics, can be used to characterize size-dependent effects near the threshold. A relationship can be drawn between thresholds and computational complexity.},

abstract="Knowledge compilation is a compelling technique for dealing with the intractability of propositional reasoning. One particularly effective target language is Deterministic Decomposable Negation Normal Form (d-DNNF). We exploit recent advances in {\#}SAT solving in order to produce a new state-of-the-art CNF {\textrightarrow} d-DNNF compiler: Dsharp. Empirical results demonstrate that Dsharp is generally an order of magnitude faster than c2d, the de facto standard for compiling to d-DNNF, while yielding a representation of comparable size.",

	abstract="Cardinality-based feature models provide the most expressive language among the existing feature modeling languages. We provide a reduction process, which allows us to transform a cardinality-based feature diagram to an appropriate regular expression. As for crosscutting constraints, we propose a formal language interpretation of them. In this way, we provide a formal language-based semantics for cardinality-based feature models. Accordingly, we describe a computational hierarchy of feature models, which guides us in how feature models can be constructively analyzed. We also characterize some existing analysis operations over feature models in terms of languages and discuss the corresponding decidability problems.",

@article{Duenas-Osorio2011,
abstract = {The increased susceptibility of lifeline systems to failure due to aging and external hazards requires efficient methods to quantify their reliability and related uncertainty. Monte Carlo simulation techniques for network-level reliability and uncertainty assessment usually require large computational experiments. Also, available analytical approaches apply mainly to simple network topologies, and are limited to providing average values, low order moments, or confidence bounds of reliability metrics. This study introduces a closed form technique to obtain the entire probability distribution of a reliability metric of customer service availability (CSA) for generic radial lifeline systems. A special case of this general formulation reduces to a simple sum of products equation, for which a recursive algorithm that exploits its structure is presented. This special-case algorithm computes the probability mass function (PMF) of CSA for systems with M elements in {\textless}file name={\{}''{\}}mice{\_}661{\_}mu1.gif{\{}''{\}} type={\{}''{\}}gif{\{}''{\}}/{\textgreater} operations, relative to conventional {\textless}file name={\{}''{\}}mice{\_}661{\_}mu2.gif{\{}''{\}} type={\{}''{\}}gif{\{}''{\}}/{\textgreater} operations, and opens the possibility of finding recursive algorithms for the general radial case. Parametric models that approximate the CSA metric are also explored and their errors quantified. The proposed radial topology reliability assessment tools and resulting probability distributions provide infrastructure owners with critical insights for informed operation and maintenance decision making under uncertainty.},
